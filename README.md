# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning

This project is a Machine Learning-based solution that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on various environmental and soil parameters. It helps farmers and agricultural experts make data-driven decisions to improve yield and resource efficiency.

## 📌 Overview

The system takes input parameters such as:
- **N**: Nitrogen content in soil
- **P**: Phosphorus content in soil
- **K**: Potassium content in soil
- **Temperature**: Atmospheric temperature (°C)
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity (%)
- **pH**: Soil pH value
- **Rainfall**: Rainfall (mm)

Using this input, the trained machine learning model predicts the best crop to grow in those conditions.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts optimal crop based on soil and climate data.
- Uses a classification ML model trained on a public dataset.
- Fast and accurate results.
- Easy to integrate with web or mobile interfaces.

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 🐍
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `joblib`
- **Model**: Random Forest Classifier (can be swapped with others like SVM, XGBoost, etc.)

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is sourced from publicly available agricultural records and includes real-world data. It consists of features like N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, mapped to the suitable crop.
